One of the most important applications of optimization is vehicle routing, in which the goal is to find the best routes for a fleet of vehicles visiting a set of locations. Usually, "best" means routes with the least total distance or cost. Here are a few examples of routing problems:

1) A package delivery company wants to assign routes for drivers to make deliveries.
2) A cable TV company wants to assign routes for technicians to make residential service calls.
3) A ride-sharing company wants to assign routes for drivers to pick up and drop off passengers.
